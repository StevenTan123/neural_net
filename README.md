# Neural Network from Scratch

A personal project where I built a simple neural network (multi-layer perceptron) from scratch in C++, using only the standard library. It is capable of fitting simple functions like XOR and sine. I have also trained a digit classifier with this using the MNIST dataset, which has reached 85% accuracy.
