# Neural Network from Scratch

A personal project where I built a simple neural network (multi-layer perceptron) from scratch in C++, using only the standard library. It is capable of fitting simple functions like XOR and sine. I have also trained a digit classifier with this using the MNIST dataset, which has reached 80% accuracy (this is still work-in-progress, as I am trying to improve the accuracy).
