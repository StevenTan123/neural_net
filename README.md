# Neural Network from Scratch

A personal project where I built a simple neural network (multi-layer perceptron) from scratch in C++, using only the standard library. Currently it is capable of fitting simple functions like XOR, sine, and cosine.
This is a work in progress; I am currently working on using this to train a digit classifier with the MNIST dataset.
